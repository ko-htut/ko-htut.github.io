# miceandmaze

![alt text](android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xhdpi/ic_launcher.png)

A simple game I wrote as part of a one/two week coding challenge on the side (while working and studying).
The app still has some minor issues and the code could be a bit more organised but all in all it was a fun
challenge and good way to really get started with flutter.

 **Repo** .

```
git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b stable
```

# How the game works

You are in control of the maze while the mouse character moves on it's own. Change the maze by swiping the walls into different places to avoid the evil rat/traps and get the cheese.

# Dino Run

The Dinosaur Game (also known as the Chrome Dino) is a browser game developed by Google and built into the Google Chrome web browser. The player guides a pixelated Tyrannosaurus rex across a side-scrolling landscape, avoiding obstacles to achieve a higher score.

Flutter Hackathon 2020 by Fireslime.

Flame and Watch is a recreation of the retro, nostalgic, Game and Watch console in Flutter, trying to keep up with the console limitations.

Try it online [here](https://fireslime.xyz/flame_and_watch) (web is still unstable, but give it a try!)

 **Repo** .

```
git clone https://github.com/praharshbhatt/flame_and_watch.git
```

# Bubble Twist


Try to remove all bubbles by making pairs of 3 or more of the same color to make them pop. The mass of bubbles will rotate upon the center when hit. If you pop all of bubbles your score multiplier will increase by 1 so that all future pops will be worth more points. Try to get the high score, good luck!
